fora-react-sandbox
==================

Fora's ReactJS sandbox which allows running untrusted React components in a browser.

This is part of the Fora Project (http://github.com/jeswin/fora).  
Building from source requires a patched coffee-script compiler (https://github.com/alubbe/coffee-script) with support for ES6 generators.
